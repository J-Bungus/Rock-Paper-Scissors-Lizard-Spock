Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
---

This is a game based off of a project from The Odin Project. It is inspired by the T.V. show The Big Bang Theory, where I first discovered this game and learned its rules.

This game will be written in two parts. First, I will make a console-only version using Javascript. Then, as I learn more about how to integrate Javascript with HTML and CSS, I will write the GUI for this game.
